									<h1>AIS Data Analysis</h1>

								<p>During my time at UC-Riverside, I was the Head of Market Research for AIS. I wanted to take a more analytical role 
									and collect data to better understand our members. the first step of the process was to create and deploy a Survey
									to all students who are interested in joining our club.
								</p>

								<p>
									<br>Over the course of two academic quarters(roughly 6 months). It is important to note that in our actual data set, 
									we collected other information such as our members full name, email addresses, and student ID. But for the purposes 
									for this project, I had chosen to take that information out.
								</p>
								<a><img src="images/collected_data.jpg" class="image fit" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									In order to perform an analysis on our data, we first need to prep the dataset for visualization: <br>
									We shorten the timestamp to only contained the date and we also added an "Academic Weeks" column 
									to help us visualize a line chart later. We also cleaned up any misspellings in the "Major" column.
									The survey also allows our members to write a free respone for some of the questions. Based on there response,
									we lumped them together in order to preserve the data during our visualization.
								</p>

								<p>
									In the example below, we can see that students have input "Econ" and "Economics" as there meajor. While both are correct,
									we need to make sure thay fit the same format. along with this imput error, "Marketing" is also spelled incorrectly. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Once the data has been cleaned, it is time to conduct data exploration with the use of pivot tables and pivot charts.

								<p>
									After we were done exploring the data, we compiled our most interesting graphs into a dashboard. we also included a few slicers
									in order to filter some of the data based upon there grade level, academic quarter, and there housing status.
